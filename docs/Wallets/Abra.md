Abra is the world’s first global investment app designed for the future of finance. Abra empowers users in more than 150 countries to invest in hundreds of cryptocurrencies via a single app while giving users the freedom to buy, sell, hold, exchange and send them anywhere, anytime.

Setting Up Your Wallet:

Download the app from Google Play or the Apple Store and complete sign up. From there, you can fund your wallet via bank transfer (US, Europe, Philippines), credit card (Mastercard, Visa), or via cryptocurrency deposit.

Get Your Recovery Phrase:

The recovery phrase, sometimes called a “wallet seed” or “backup phrase,” consists of thirteen words that need to be written down and stored in a safe place. If anything happens to a user’s Abra wallet or the phone that the wallet is installed on, ONLY the recovery phrase can be used to restore and recover all funds stored in the wallet.
