# Getting Started With Vertcoin

## What is Vertcoin?

Vertcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be sent from peer-to-peer over the internet. Though similar to Litecoin and Bitcoin, Vertcoin has one major difference; pledged ASIC resistance and user governance. An enforced social contract that exists in the Vertcoin community promising to fork proof-of-work algorithms in order to resist ASIC miners from being used on the Vertcoin network allows for user governance of the Vertcoin network. Discouraging development of ASICs via this enforced social contract keeps the barrier to entry for mining accessible. While this may seem like a minor change, it has larger implications when it comes to the fair distribution, politics, and decentralization of the coin. Vertcoin stays true to the original vision of cryptocurrency: a financial system owned by its users, the peopleâ€™s coin.



##What do I need to get started

To get started, the first thing you'll need is a Vertcoin Wallet. Wallets are used to store, receive and send coins to other addresses. They also play the important role of storing your private key. (You can think of a private key as the unique code that identifies your wallet and the corresponding funds.) Though there are many wallets to chose from, we recommend using the [Core Wallet](/Wallets/Core-Wallet/). Core is the only wallet to currently support p2pool mining.

     Never share your private keys with anyone. Whoever owns the private key has the access to spend the funds in your wallet. Keep it safe and back it up to multiple locations.
